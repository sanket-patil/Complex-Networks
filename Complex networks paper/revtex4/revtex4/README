Not Included   
------------
The following packages are required by REVTeX but are not
included in this distribution. Please obtain from CTAN
(Comprehensive TeX Archive Network), e.g. <http://www.ctan.org/>. These
can also be downloaded from <http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/>.

natbib.dtx   - Version 7 or later needed
natbib.ins   - LaTeX this to create natbib.sty and natbib
               documentation from natbib.dtx
bm.dtx       - Bold math style - part of (current!) standard LaTeX2e tools
bm.sty       - generated from bm.dtx by running tools.ins

An up-to-date installation of AMS-LaTeX is also required for certain
documentclass options. Version 2.0 or higher is needed. It is
available from <http://www.ams.org/tex/>.

Recommended styles and packages
--------------------------
By implementing REVTeX as a native LaTeX2e document class, users can now 
take advantage of many of the well-supported LaTeX2e packages available.
Here are some that are particularly useful and recommended.

longtable.sty for tables running to multiple pages - part of a
standard LaTeX2e distribution.

hyperref.sty for hyperlinking - should work well with REVTeX 4.

graphics.sty and graphicx.sty for figure inclusion - part of LaTeX2e's
standard distribution.

Installation
------------
To install REVTeX 4, put revtex4.cls, *.rtx, *.sty, and *.bst (files
listed under 'Essential Files' above) somewhere in your TEXINPUTS path
or whereever your TeX software looks for input files. Under the TDS,
you should install them into $TEXMFLOCAL/tex/latex/revtex4. The *.bst
files should go under $TEXMFLOCAL/bibtex/bst/revtex4. Run the
appropriate update command (texhash, initexmf -u, etc.). Install
required non-REVTeX packages (natbib and bm). Please consult the
documentaton for your local TeX package for more information. MikTeX
users should use version MikTeX 2.1.

Credits
-------
David Carlisle created the initial versions of REVTeX 4 under
commission by the APS. Arthur Ogawa has extensively reworked those
early versions and added much new functionality. Mark Doyle, APS
Manager of Product Development coordinated the effort. The APS is the
maintainer of REVTeX 4, and all bugs are our responsibility.  Please
e-mail complaints to revtex@aps.org.

Backwards compatibility
-----------------------
The REVTeX 4 class file has been named revtex4.cls to distinguish it
from its predecessors. If the class file is copied to revtex.cls,
files created with earlier versions of REVTeX should still work.

LaTeX2e requirements
--------------------
REVTeX 4 requires LaTeX2e [1996/06/01]
