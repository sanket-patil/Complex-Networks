% This is code written by Leaelaf Hailemariam to compute the Total (1/km)

% vs (1/C) ratios for different networks. Here, k is the number of prey a

% species has and m is the number of predators a species has. C is the

% connectance; defined by the ratio of the actual number of edges divided

% by the number of theoretical edges (n(n-1)). Written on May 12, 2007 at
